## 🧩 1. Why CI/CD Exists — The Problem in Traditional Development
Before CI/CD, software teams often faced big challenges:

- Merge conflicts when combining code from different developers

- Integration failures — code works on one machine but fails when merged

- Manual build, test, and deployment — slow and error-prone

- The classic excuse: “It works on my machine!”

CI/CD was created to solve these problems through automation.
