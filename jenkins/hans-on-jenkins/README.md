# Hands-on Jenkins Setting Up

## 📌 Introduction
There are multiple ways to deploy Jenkins depending on your infrastructure and operational requirements. Common deployment options include containers, virtual machines, on-prem servers, and even Kubernetes clusters.

In this lab, we will demonstrate two practical installation methods:

### Deploy Jenkins using Docker Compose

- Fast, portable, easy to maintain

- Suitable for testing, labs, and container-based environments

### Install Jenkins directly on a virtual machine (self-hosted)

- Traditional installation method

- Suitable for dedicated servers or environments without container infrastructure

These two approaches will help you understand both containerized and non-containerized Jenkins setups, giving you flexibility to choose the best deployment model for your DevOps workflow.
